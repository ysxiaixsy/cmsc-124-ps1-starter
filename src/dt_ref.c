/*
 * dt_ref.c: Owned references for Unit 5, Section J.
 *
 * This module detects three ownership failures.
 *
 * A dangling reference retains an address after release.
 * Reading that address has undefined behavior. It can return old data or terminate.
 *
 * A double release gives the same allocation to free twice.
 * This operation has undefined behavior. The visible failure can occur later.
 *
 * An unreleased allocation still has an owner at the final check. The driver
 * reports DT_ERR_LEAK before cleanup.
 *
 * A released flag lets this small interface report the first two mistakes as
 * DT_ERR_RELEASED. The driver's final check reports the third as DT_ERR_LEAK.
 * These checks model this assignment's ownership contract only.
 *
 * Ownership stops at the cell. dt_ref_new copies the value into an owned cell.
 * The environment still owns a string that the copied value references.
